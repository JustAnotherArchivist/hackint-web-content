The DN42 entrypoint uses a certificate signed by [their own CA](https://dn42.net/services/Certificate-Authority). Using this certificate requires a client that supports Server Name Indication (SNI).

Connection should also be possible from within [chaosvpn] and Freifunks [Intercity-VPN], provided you don't filter DN42 address space.
