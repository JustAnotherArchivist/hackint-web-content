After finalising our upgrade of the GroupServ interface, we now would like to announce the availability of custom group-based virtual hosts. Currently, this is an offer for hackerspaces, Freifunk communities, and FOSS projects only - other applications may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

If you are a group founder (flag +F), you can join the #hackint channel and request your vhost. Members of the group need the +v flag to have the custom virtual host offered through HostServ.

Happy New Year!
