## Services

We offer both the usual services like **ChanServ**, **NickServ** and **GroupServ**, along with some custom services. Official services can be recognized by their hostmask: `services.hackint.org`.

To get help with a service, message it with the **help** command. For example with NickServ that is:

```
/msg nickserv help
```

### NickServ
This service will protect your nickname. Certain access rights to *channels* or *groups* might be linked to it.

### ChanServ
Enables registration of channels to secure ownership and enable management of access flags for both *users* and *groups*.

*Using this service requires a registered account with NickServ.*

### GroupServ
Provides an abstraction layer for group-based access management. Registered
NickServ accounts may create and invite other registered users into groups.

*Using this service requires a registered account with NickServ.*

### ALIS
Lists available channels with lots of filter options available.

### LogServ (*unavailable at present*)

Provides a few lines of backlog to joining users, which is similar to how Jabber MUCs work.

### Greasel
The Greasel fights spam and currently does not offer any user interface. This might change in the future.
