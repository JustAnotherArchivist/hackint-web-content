## Services

Hackint offers **ChanServ**, **NickServ** and **GroupServ**, along with some custom services.
All official hackint services can be recognized by the hostmask **services.hackint.org**.

The following custom services are available:

- **ALIS**. Lists available channels with lots of filter options available.
- **LogServ**. Can be used to get a backlog for a channel. Joining users will be sent the last few lines that were written in a channel. This is mainly useful for channels that use hackint's irc to jabber gateway.
- **Greasel**. The Greasel fights spam and currently does not offer any user interface. This might change in the future, however.
