## Congratulations!
You have created a new user on hackint anonymously. Now all you have to do is configure your irc client to use SASL to log in.


## SASL authentication

SASL authentication is an extension to the IRC client to server protocol that makes authentication part of the initial IRC registration handshake. Meaning, by the time you have a nick in the irc network and are able to join channels, you are registered with services. The downside of this is that any time services are down, you will not be able to connect to the IRC network.
